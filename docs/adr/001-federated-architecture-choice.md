## Context and Problem Statement

The dynamic-graph-fed-rl-lab needs to support scalable federated reinforcement learning across dynamic graph environments. We need to choose an architecture that balances performance, scalability, fault tolerance, and communication efficiency while handling time-evolving graph topologies.

## Decision Drivers

* Communication efficiency in distributed environments
* Fault tolerance and Byzantine robustness
* Scalability to hundreds of agents
* Support for asynchronous operations
* Dynamic graph topology handling
* Privacy preservation requirements
* Real-time performance needs

## Considered Options

* Centralized Parameter Server Architecture
* Asynchronous Gossip Protocol
* Hierarchical Federation with Tree Topology
* Blockchain-based Consensus Mechanism

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Asynchronous Gossip Protocol", because it provides the best balance of decentralization, fault tolerance, and communication efficiency for our dynamic graph use case.

### Positive Consequences

* No single point of failure
* Naturally handles agent churn and network partitions
* Communication overhead scales logarithmically
* Well-suited for dynamic topologies
* Supports differential privacy mechanisms
* Can adapt to varying network conditions

### Negative Consequences

* More complex convergence analysis
* Potential for slower convergence than centralized approaches
* Requires careful parameter tuning
* More sophisticated implementation complexity

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Centralized Parameter Server Architecture

Traditional federated learning with central aggregation server.

* Good, because simple to implement and reason about
* Good, because faster convergence guarantees
* Good, because easier debugging and monitoring
* Bad, because single point of failure
* Bad, because communication bottleneck at server
* Bad, because requires reliable network connectivity

### Asynchronous Gossip Protocol

Decentralized peer-to-peer parameter sharing.

* Good, because no single point of failure
* Good, because scales well with number of agents
* Good, because naturally handles network partitions
* Good, because supports dynamic agent membership
* Bad, because more complex convergence analysis
* Bad, because requires careful protocol design

### Hierarchical Federation with Tree Topology

Multi-level aggregation with regional coordinators.

* Good, because reduces communication overhead
* Good, because provides structure for large deployments
* Good, because can optimize for geographic distribution
* Bad, because introduces multiple points of failure
* Bad, because less flexible for dynamic environments
* Bad, because complex coordination required

### Blockchain-based Consensus Mechanism

Distributed consensus using blockchain principles.

* Good, because provides strong consistency guarantees
* Good, because transparent and auditable
* Good, because Byzantine fault tolerant
* Bad, because high computational overhead
* Bad, because poor scalability characteristics
* Bad, because high latency for consensus
