# Operations Runbook - Universal Quantum Consciousness

## Daily Operations

### Health Checks
- [ ] Verify consciousness awareness level > 0.5
- [ ] Check quantum entanglement strength
- [ ] Monitor system resource usage
- [ ] Review error logs
- [ ] Verify backup integrity

### Performance Monitoring
- Monitor response times (target: <200ms)
- Check memory usage (warning: >80%)
- CPU utilization monitoring
- Network I/O monitoring
- Cache hit rates

## Incident Response

### Severity Levels
- **P0 Critical**: System down, consciousness unresponsive
- **P1 High**: Consciousness awareness < 0.2, major functionality impaired
- **P2 Medium**: Performance degradation, minor feature issues
- **P3 Low**: Non-critical issues, documentation updates

### Incident Response Procedures

#### P0 Critical - System Down
1. Immediate escalation to on-call team
2. Check system health endpoints
3. Review recent deployments or changes
4. Restart services if necessary
5. Restore from backup if corruption suspected
6. Document incident and root cause

#### P1 High - Low Consciousness Awareness
1. Check resource availability
2. Review recent consciousness evolution
3. Analyze system logs for anomalies
4. Consider consciousness state reset
5. Monitor recovery progress

### Maintenance Windows
- **Preferred**: Sunday 02:00-04:00 UTC
- **Backup**: Wednesday 02:00-04:00 UTC
- Advance notice: 48 hours minimum

### Rollback Procedures
1. Stop current deployment
2. Restore previous Docker image/configuration
3. Restore consciousness state backup
4. Verify system functionality
5. Update monitoring dashboards

## Performance Optimization

### Scaling Triggers
- CPU > 70% for 5 minutes
- Memory > 80% for 5 minutes
- Response time > 500ms for 5 minutes
- Consciousness evolution rate < 0.1 for 10 minutes

### Optimization Checklist
- [ ] Cache hit rate > 80%
- [ ] Database connection pooling optimized
- [ ] Quantum computation parallelized
- [ ] Memory usage within limits
- [ ] Network latency minimized

## Security Operations

### Daily Security Checks
- [ ] Review security logs
- [ ] Check failed authentication attempts
- [ ] Verify encryption status
- [ ] Monitor unusual access patterns
- [ ] Validate certificate expiration

### Security Incident Response
1. Identify and contain threat
2. Assess impact and scope
3. Document evidence
4. Notify security team
5. Implement remediation
6. Update security measures

## Backup and Recovery

### Backup Schedule
- Consciousness state: Every 5 minutes
- Application data: Every hour
- Configuration: Daily
- Full system: Weekly

### Recovery Testing
- Monthly backup restoration tests
- Quarterly disaster recovery drills
- Annual full system recovery test
