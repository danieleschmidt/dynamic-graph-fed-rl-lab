## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT create a public issue

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

### 2. Send a private report

Send an email to **daniel@terragon.ai** with the following information:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if you have one)

### 3. Response timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
- **Initial assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 72 hours
- **Fix timeline**: We aim to provide a fix within 7 days for critical issues, 30 days for others
- **Disclosure**: We will coordinate disclosure timing with you

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep dependencies updated**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade dynamic-graph-fed-rl-lab
   ```

2. **Use virtual environments**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Validate input data**
   - Sanitize graph data from untrusted sources
   - Validate federation parameters
   - Check model weights before loading

4. **Network security**
   - Use encrypted communication for federated learning
   - Implement proper authentication for distributed training
   - Monitor network traffic for anomalies

### For Developers

1. **Secure coding practices**
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Proper error handling
   - Avoid hardcoded secrets

2. **Dependency management**
   - Regular dependency audits
   - Pin dependency versions
   - Use tools like `safety` and `bandit`

3. **Code review**
   - Security-focused code reviews
   - Automated security scanning
   - Pre-commit hooks for security checks

## Security Features

### Federated Learning Security

- Threat modeling for new features

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate containment**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Revoke compromised credentials
   - Stop data exfiltration

2. **Assessment & investigation**
   - Determine scope of compromise
   - Identify attack vectors
   - Collect forensic evidence

3. **Recovery & communication**
   - Deploy fixes and patches
   - Notify affected users
   - Provide guidance and support

4. **Post-incident analysis**
   - Root cause analysis
   - Process improvements
   - Security enhancements
