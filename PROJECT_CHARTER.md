# Project Charter: Dynamic Graph Fed-RL Lab

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Dynamic Graph Federated Reinforcement Learning Laboratory  
**Project Code:** DGFRL  
**Charter Date:** August 1, 2025  
**Charter Version:** 1.0  

## Executive Summary

The Dynamic Graph Fed-RL Lab is an open-source research and development platform that advances the state-of-the-art in federated reinforcement learning for time-evolving graph environments. This project addresses critical challenges in distributed decision-making for real-world infrastructure systems where both network topology and dynamics change over time.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
1. **Scalability Limitations**: Existing RL systems cannot scale to city-scale infrastructure with thousands of decision points
2. **Privacy Concerns**: Centralized learning requires sharing sensitive operational data
3. **Dynamic Environments**: Most systems assume static topologies, failing in real-world scenarios
4. **Communication Efficiency**: High bandwidth requirements limit practical deployment
5. **Fault Tolerance**: Lack of robustness to node failures and adversarial attacks

### Business Impact
- **$2.3B annually** in traffic congestion costs in major cities
- **15-30%** power grid inefficiencies due to suboptimal control
- **$150B globally** in supply chain disruptions from poor coordination
- **Critical infrastructure vulnerabilities** from centralized control systems

## Project Vision

**Vision Statement:** To democratize intelligent control of dynamic networked systems through privacy-preserving, scalable federated learning.

**Mission Statement:** We develop open-source tools and algorithms that enable organizations to deploy intelligent, adaptive control systems while preserving privacy and ensuring robustness.
