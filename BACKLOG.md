# 📊 Autonomous Value Backlog

**Repository**: dynamic-graph-fed-rl-lab  
**Maturity Level**: MATURING (65%)  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-01T13:10:00Z  
**Next Execution**: Triggered on PR merge or manual execution

## 🎯 Continuous Value Discovery

This repository implements an autonomous SDLC enhancement system that continuously discovers, prioritizes, and executes the highest-value work items. The system uses a hybrid scoring model combining:

- **WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First)**: Business value, time criticality, risk reduction, opportunity enablement
- **ICE (Impact, Confidence, Ease)**: Impact assessment, execution confidence, implementation ease  
- **Technical Debt Score**: Debt impact, interest accumulation, hotspot analysis

## 🔄 Value Discovery Sources

- **Git History Analysis**: TODO/FIXME/HACK markers in code comments
- **Static Analysis**: Code quality issues, complexity metrics, style violations
- **Security Scanning**: Vulnerability detection, dependency audits
- **SDLC Gap Analysis**: Missing tooling, configurations, automation
- **Technical Debt Monitoring**: Code complexity, maintainability metrics

## 📈 Execution Metrics

## 🎯 Value Scoring Examples

### High-Value Item Example
```
Title: Fix critical security vulnerability in JAX dependency
Category: security
WSJF Score: 45.2 (High business impact + urgent timing)
ICE Score: 648 (High impact × High confidence × Medium ease)
Tech Debt Score: 85 (High security debt)
Composite Score: 78.4 (HIGH PRIORITY)
Estimated Effort: 2.0 hours
```

### Medium-Value Item Example  
```
Title: Add pre-commit hooks configuration
Category: automation
WSJF Score: 18.7 (Medium impact + enables future efficiency)
ICE Score: 420 (Medium impact × High confidence × High ease)  
Tech Debt Score: 25 (Moderate process debt)
Composite Score: 52.3 (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
Estimated Effort: 1.5 hours
```

## 🔄 Continuous Learning

The system continuously learns and adapts:

- **Estimation Accuracy**: Tracks predicted vs actual effort and impact
- **Scoring Calibration**: Adjusts weights based on execution outcomes
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies similar work items for better predictions
- **Value Validation**: Measures actual business impact of completed items

## 🔧 Configuration

The autonomous system is configured via `.terragon/config.yaml`:

```yaml
repository:
  maturity_level: "maturing"
  maturity_score: 65

scoring:
  weights:
    wsjf: 0.6      # Heavy weight on business value
    ice: 0.1       # Light weight on ICE
    technicalDebt: 0.2  # Moderate debt focus
    security: 0.1  # Security boost applied separately

execution:
  maxConcurrentTasks: 1
  testRequirements:
    minCoverage: 80
```

## 🎉 Success Stories

*Will be populated as the system executes and delivers value*

## 🚨 Rollback Procedures

If autonomous execution fails:

1. **Automatic Rollback**: System automatically reverts changes on failure
2. **Branch Cleanup**: Removes failed feature branches  
3. **Error Logging**: Records failure details for learning
4. **Manual Review**: High-risk items require manual approval

## 📞 Human Intervention

The system is designed to be autonomous but includes human oversight:

- **High-Risk Items**: Security changes > 4 hours require approval
- **Breaking Changes**: Any changes affecting public APIs require review
- **Custom Logic**: Complex refactoring requires manual implementation
- **Business Decisions**: Strategic architectural changes need human input
